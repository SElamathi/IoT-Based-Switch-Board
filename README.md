# IoT-Based-Switch-Board
With the rapid advancement of technology, the concept of smart homes is becoming increasingly popular across the globe. One of the key components of smart home automation is the ability to control electrical appliances such as lights, fans, and sockets remotely, without relying on traditional mechanical switches. The Internet of Things (IoT) has made it possible to create intelligent systems that connect physical devices to the internet, allowing for seamless remote control, automation, and monitoring. The IoT-Based Smart Switchboard project is designed to replace conventional switchboards with a modern, efficient, and connected system. This system allows users to control their electrical appliances using a smartphone, tablet, or computer through Wi-Fi connectivity. This is particularly useful for situations where physical access to a switch is not possible, or for users who want to control appliances while away from home. At the heart of the system is a microcontroller like the ESP8266 (NodeMCU) or ESP32, which connects to the internet via Wi-Fi. This microcontroller is programmed to interact with a mobile app (such as Blynk, MIT App Inventor, or a custom-built app) or a web interface. When a user sends a command from the app, it is transmitted over the internet to the microcontroller, which then activates the appropriate relay module to turn a device ON or OFF
